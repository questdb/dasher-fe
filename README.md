# QuestDB front-end work sample

Hey!

Thanks for your interest in joining the team.

## The task

This exercise is designed to mirror a realistic dev scenario.

There is a NextJS app with a base page, and a view.

The view is located at `localhost:3000/audit`.

Your mission:

1. Get the app running
2. Complete the `Auditor` component
3. Polish the _Audit_ experience

The component is "dumb" out of the box.

It needs data from an API.

The API is located at: `src/app/api/routes.tsx`.

It has enough features to inform two main functions in the `Auditor` component:

1. `activityItems`: The flow of audit information
2. `stats`: Interesting aggregates based on the audit flow

How you handle the data and display these items is up to you.

## Evaluation

We are evaluating:

1. What you do with the component
2. How you handle the API
3. How you handle the page route

There is also a [THOUGHTS.md](/thoughts.md) page.

As you go, feel free to write things.

Brevity is OK - it's for you to share what's on your mind.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us!

## Submission

To submit:

1. Fork this private repository
