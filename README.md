# QuestDB front-end work sample

Hey!

Thanks for your interest in joining the team.

The following is designed to take about 2-4 hours.

Or "one solid working block".

There is no deadline.

However, we do have lots of folks applying, so keep that in mind!

Time is of the essence.

## The task

This exercise is designed to mirror a realistic dev scenario.

There is a NextJS app with a base page, and a view.

The view is located at `localhost:3000/audit`.

Your mission:

1. Get the app running
2. Update the Auditor UI to handle more rows
 - Can you handle 1000 rows? 100k? 1.5B?
3. (Stretch goal) Generate stats using row data
 - Hint: _QuestDB queries_

1000 rows is no problem, but after 100k things get dicey.

The DOM will explode, and it looks like our table won't cut it.

How can we improve this? Performance is key!

Look for `@TODO`!

## Evaluation

We are evaluating:

1. How you handle the rows
2. How you constructed your "table"
3. Did you handle stats? How?
4. How you package the PR

There is also an **optional** [THOUGHTS.md](thoughts.md) page.

As you go, feel free to write any interesting thoughts.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us!

## Submission

To submit:

1. Fork this private repository
2. Submit a PR from your fork via a private branch

Please ensure the materials remain private.

We want to maintain fairness and anonymity!
